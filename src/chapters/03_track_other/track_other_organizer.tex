\chapter{Event Organizer Rules}

All Track Other events follow the Track Racing event organizer rules, unless otherwise noted.

\section{Communication}

\oldrule{2.20}
If a large convention advertises events with the names of the ones detailed in this section, they must use the rules provided here.
If hosts desire to do variations on these rules, the events must be labeled accordingly.
Example: ``Track Gliding; Modified''.
In cases such as this, hosts must remember to provide detailed rules for these events at the same time the events are announced.

\section{Age Groups}

\oldrule{2.20} %comment-2016 Do we need this?
Age group breakdown is also up to the host.
