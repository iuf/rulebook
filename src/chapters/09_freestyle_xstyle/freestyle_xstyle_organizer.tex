Runs must be between 1 and 2 minutes 30 seconds.

\section{Judges Workshop}

The host must schedule a judges workshop for training X-Style judges.
This may be held just before the competition if the riders will also be judges.

\section{Age Groups and Categories}

\oldrule{6.49}
There can be two distinct tournaments for junior (age 14 or younger) and senior (age 15 and older) riders.
