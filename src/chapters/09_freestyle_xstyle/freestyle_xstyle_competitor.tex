\subsection{Definitions}
\oldrule{6.47}
\textbf{Unicycle Skill}: The main action of a movement is done on and with the unicycle.

\emph{Example 1}: If you do a handstand, while the unicycle is laying on the floor, this is a non-unicycle trick, because the main action is the handstand.

\emph{Example 2}: If you do a handstand on the unicycle, while it is standing upside down, this is a unicycle trick, because the main action is balancing the unicycle while doing the handstand.

\subsection{Runs}
\oldrule{6.48}
Every competitor has a run in which the rider shows his/her skills.
A DJ plays music for each run.
After the run the DJ waits until the current skill is finished and stops the music.
Riders can also hand in their own music.
Riders can ask the DJ to give a time-remaining notification during his/her run.

\subsection{Run Length}
\oldrule{6.48.1}
This is the recommended format: \\
The length of a competitor's run is determined by the round.
\begin{itemize}
\item If three or more rounds: \\
1st round: 1 minute \\
Intermediate rounds: 1 minute 30 seconds \\
Finals: 2 minutes.
\item If two rounds: \\
1st round: 1 minute 30 seconds \\
Finals: 2 minutes
\item If one round: 2 minutes
\end{itemize}

\section{Starting Groups}
\oldrule{6.49}
The group of competing riders is split randomly into starting groups of about the same size with a maximum 10 riders.

\subsection{Tournament}
\oldrule{6.50}
The best 3 riders of each group advance to the next round, forming a new pool of competitors.
If there is a tie on one of the first 3 places which extends to more than the 3 riders, all involved riders advance.
This pool again gets split into starting groups and the next round begins.
The final round consists of only one starting group.
In the final round the best 3 riders are awarded for the first, second and third place of the competition.

\subsubsection{Ties}
\oldrule{6.50.1}
If the competition doesn't allow ties (e.g. Unicon), the tied placed riders of the final round will be given another run.
The run will be one minute.
The judges bring all tied riders in order.
If there is still a tie between riders, the tie rules will be applied again, until all ties are resolved.
