\section{Definition}

\oldrule{6.1}
In Standard Skill, riders demonstrate pure skill and mastery on a standard unicycle, by performing up to 18 skills they have preselected.
Standard Skill judging is based on the point value of the skills and quality of their execution, not the `show.'

\oldrule{6.32}
Group Standard Skill is similar to Individual Standard Skill, but with four person teams of any sex, on standard unicycles only.
Rules are published separately.
This event is held at the discretion of the convention host.
