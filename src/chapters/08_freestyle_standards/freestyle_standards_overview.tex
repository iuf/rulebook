\section{Definition}

\oldrule{6.1}
In Standard Skill, riders demonstrate pure skill and mastery on a standard unicycle, by performing up to 18 skills they have preselected.
Standard Skill judging is based on the point value of the skills and quality of their execution, not the `show.'

\oldrule{6.32}

Rules are published separately.
This event is held at the discretion of the convention host.
